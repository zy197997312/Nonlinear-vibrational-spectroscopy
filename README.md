# Nonlinear-vibrational-spectroscopy
The partial code example of the paper named investigation on vibrational modes coupling in the anharmonic potential via second- and third-order nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy

We use a classical iterative method to derive and obtain the nonlinear response up to third-order of an N-body system with arbitrary modes couplings in the anharmonic potential. The nonlinear dependences of the dipole moments on the vibrational coordinates are also introduced without modes couplings.

These codes just show an example and all of them will be presented soon.
